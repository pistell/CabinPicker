## About

This is a final project I did for class. It is a fake cabin rental company. The cabins are entered into a JSON file and populated throughout the site. If I had to do this again I wouldn't use the DatePicker from FoxRun as it has not been updated in over 4 years. jQuery UI has a built in date picker with much better documentation.

## Things to improve on
- Use jquery.ui.datepicker
- Form validation on Contact form and Reservation form
- Cabin availability key in JSON file has limited functionality
- Display dates when cabins are booked
- Add a display page for each cabin to show off more pics and details, not a link to the reservations page
